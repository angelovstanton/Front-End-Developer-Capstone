Problem Definition (Georg Ivanov)
----------------------------------
Little Lemon, a growing Mediterranean restaurant, currently does not offer an online table reservation system. This lack of digital booking functionality presents a significant usability gap, especially for busy professionals like Georg Ivanov—a marketing manager who regularly arranges client lunches during short breaks.

Georg prefers seamless mobile experiences that allow him to manage bookings quickly without the need to call or navigate complex forms. Without an online reservation feature, users like Georg are forced to resort to phone calls or physical visits, which disrupts their productivity and adds friction to the user journey.

Additionally, the absence of an online system puts Little Lemon at a competitive disadvantage, especially compared to other restaurants that offer efficient digital booking experiences. It also strains the restaurant's internal operations by relying on manual scheduling, which increases the risk of double bookings and inefficient time management for staff.

Designing a mobile-first, user-friendly online reservation experience is essential to improving customer satisfaction, supporting business growth, and aligning with modern expectations for digital convenience.

----------------------------------
Scenario:
----------------------------------
Georg Ivanov, a marketing manager in Plovdiv, is heading to a client meeting when he realizes he needs to book a lunch table at Little Lemon for the next day. He has just a few minutes between appointments and tries to reserve a table on his phone. Georg opens the restaurant's website, expecting a fast and easy reservation option. However, the absence of a clear "Book a Table" button forces him to search for information, wasting valuable time. Frustrated, he considers calling instead, which disrupts his productivity and contradicts his preference for quick, mobile-first interactions.

----------------------------------
User Needs and Pain Points
----------------------------------
• Inconvenience - busy users like Georg find it frustrating to call or visit a restaurant just to make a reservation. During short breaks between meetings, they expect to complete such tasks online in under a minute.
• Poor Visibility of Booking Options - the reservation feature is not prominently displayed or easy to access on the mobile website, leading to confusion and time wasted looking for a “Book a Table” button.
• Inefficient Manual Process - after calling to book a table, Georg still has to manually enter the confirmation into his calendar and take screenshots to remember the details—adding extra steps to an already busy day.
• Mobile Unfriendliness - current processes are not optimized for mobile-first users. Forms may be too complex or visually cluttered on smaller screens, increasing user drop-off rates.
• Lack of Confirmation Features - without integration for calendar syncing or automated confirmations (via email or push notifications), there’s a risk that users will forget or misplace booking details.
• Competitive Disadvantage - restaurants with fast, mobile-friendly reservation tools are more likely to be chosen by users like Georg. Little Lemon risks losing customers who favor digital-first solutions.

----------------------------------
Features Required
----------------------------------
• Clear Call-to-Action (CTA) - add a prominent “Reserve a Table” button on the homepage and main navigation of the mobile site. It should be clearly visible without scrolling, allowing users like Georg to take action instantly.
• Mobile-First Reservation Form - design a minimal, clutter-free form that includes only essential fields—date, time, number of guests, and special requests (e.g., “quiet table,” “client lunch”). Ensure all form fields are large, well-spaced, and optimized for thumbs on small screens.
• Smart Confirmation - automatically send a confirmation via email and allow users to add the reservation directly to their calendar (Google, iCal). Optionally, show a confirmation summary screen post-submission that users can screenshot.
• Fast Interaction - use progressive disclosure to keep the form clean—show only the most relevant fields first. Avoid requiring users to log in or create accounts to complete a booking.
• Mobile Responsiveness - ensure all UI elements are fully responsive, easy to tap, and do not require zooming or horizontal scrolling on mobile devices.
• Accessibility - follow accessibility best practices to ensure the form is usable with screen readers, high-contrast displays, and includes keyboard navigation for assistive technology users.
• Interactive Components - incorporate modern UI features like radio buttons for number of guests or reservation time, and feedback animations for completed actions (e.g., button color change, confirmation checkmark).

Solution Objectives
----------------------------------
• Clear Call-to-Action (CTA) - create a clean and easy-to-find reservation entry point that allows users like Georg to reserve a table quickly without distractions. It should reduce hesitation and support fast action-taking.
• Increased Efficiency - introduce a seamless booking experience that requires minimal input and eliminates the need for follow-up manual steps, such as adding events to calendars or calling to confirm.
• Enhanced Mobile Experience - Georg primarily uses a smartphone, so the solution should be built mobile-first, providing high usability with intuitive flows, fast-loading screens, and responsive design.
• Competitive Differentiation - by offering a sleek, professional reservation flow, Little Lemon can attract tech-savvy customers and stand out among competitors that rely on phone-based bookings.
• Better Operational Workflow - automating reservations via an integrated system (and reducing phone calls) frees up staff time, avoids double bookings, and improves accuracy in managing table availability.
